# ps_http
This simple Powershell script adds a function allowing you to view any HTTP connections (TCP on port 80).
Add this to a Powershell profile, or use on its own, to activate the function at each start. 
Once active, type "http" and all port 80 connections will display.
This is useful to run a quick test to see if any applications are ignoring https settings or opening insecure channels without your knowledge.
